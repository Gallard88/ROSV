eth_test_tx & eth_test_rx
These scripts are useful for measuring the maximum performance over 
a link. tx sends a large block of data to rx, which dumps to /dev/null
This system uses port 12345. Run rx first on the client. Then start tx 
on the server side.
Both programs close when the transfer is complete.
