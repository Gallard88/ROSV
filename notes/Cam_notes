Camera up and running connected straight to R.PI.
GUVCView can prodide:
5-6 - FPS at 320x240.
3-4 - FPS at 640x480.
There appears to be ~ 1sec delay.

Camera Stream provides ~1-3 FPS (VLC doesn't provide the frame rate unlike GUVCView).
2-3 sec delay.
For now I will continue to remote into the device using ssh and use Guvcview until I cam improve the frame rate / delay in FFServer/FFMpeg.
